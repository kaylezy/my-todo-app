# my-todo-app
## This simple todo app is a version of Altschool project giving to us by the instructor to test our knowledge on everything we have been taught on Javascript.
## In this project, we only focus on the frontend only, without a database or backend server.
## This project was created using vanilla Js with a vite bundler to run the project.
Below is the link to the hosted project.
